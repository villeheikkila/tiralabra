## Weekly Report, week 4

### What have I done this week?

Read up on huffman algorithm works, learned how to read command line arguments in Swift.
I first created the required code needed to parse the command line arguments and added the required commands.
Added some very simple logic to check that the provided arguments are valid.
Added noop implementations for huffman and lz77.
Then I created the encoding part for the huffman coding and tried it it with a simple test input (took some random page from tko-aly's website). When it looked correct, I also added the decoding part.
I manually checked that the input and output matched the initial files. Looks to work now.

I was planning to add real tests for this but didn't have time yet.

### How The Project Has Progressed

A lot, the first algo is completely implemented but the comments and tests are seriously lacking.

### What I Learned This Week / Today

How huffman coding works, some new useful functionality provided by Foundation

### What Was Unclear Or Difficult?

Huffman coding was a bit confusing, took quite a few tries to get it right(?) even though the algorithm is simple

### What Will I Do Next?

Add tests for huffman coding part. LZ77 support.

### LLM usage

I asked some clarifying questions about huffman coding and how to parse command line arguments with Swift.
