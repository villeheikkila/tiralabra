## Weekly Report, week 4

### What have I done this week?

Mainly focused on LZ77 binary encoding/decoding and clean up

### How The Project Has Progressed

Finished the first iteration of the LZ77 algo, added comments and improved naming of functions. Separated the file operations out of the algos package.

### What I Learned This Week / Today

Some details how to do binary operations with Swift

### What Was Unclear Or Difficult?

Converting LZ77 to a binary format in a sane way

### What Will I Do Next?

Add tests for individual parts of the code to see why the compression does work as expected.
Fix possible bugs, clean up the remaining files and large tests files. Finish documentation

### LLM usage

A lot of chatting about binary encoding
