#### TKT20010 Laboratoriotyöskentely, 13.3.–3.5.2024 (Tietojenkäsittelytieteen kandiohjelma)

## Specification Document

### Overview

The goal of the project is to compare Huffman coding to LZ77 algorithm. The comparison focuses on compression efficiency and is done by taking in a given input and producing a compressed output and comparing the size difference between the two.
The project will be written using Swift and the final result is an executable Swift binary that accepts input text file as a parameter. Running the binary then produces the compressed output file and prints a report to stdout.

### Algorithms

Huffman Coding, LZ77

### Problem

How to efficiently compress text using at least two different algorthms and comparing the results

### Input & Output

The input is text and output is compressed text and the necessary artifacts to decode the compressed text

### Time Complexity

// TODO

### Programming language

I plan to write this project in Swift. I'm well versed in Swift, Dart and TypeScript.
